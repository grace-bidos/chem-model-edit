# Specs Directory

This repository keeps specification artifacts in two buckets:

- `specs/current/`: active specs used for current delivery.
- `specs/archive/`: historical specs kept for record/reference.

Current planning source-of-truth is Linear. Many older markdown specs are retained
only for historical context and should not be treated as active requirements.
