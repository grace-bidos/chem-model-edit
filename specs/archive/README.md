# Archived Specs

This directory stores historical specification artifacts.

Status policy:

- Treat all files here as `Archived`.
- Do not use archived files as source-of-truth for new implementation.
- When needed, copy relevant context into a new active issue/spec instead of
  reviving archived docs in place.
